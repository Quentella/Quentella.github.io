My name is Quentella Johnson and I am a positive, flexible, and a hard worker who enjoys staying very busy. I am always willing to try new and better things. I am a recent graduate of Gulfport High School, where i was apart of many extra curricular activities such as, the Lady Admirals basketball team as captain, the orchestra, DECA club, Generation Free Club, Jr. Quota Club, and Key Club. Being apart of these organizations I have developed leadership and problem solving skills. My two strengths that I have acquired are good communication skills and I am very outgoing when it comes to trying new things.
